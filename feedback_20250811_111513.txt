suggestions for improvement:
- The `get_words_from_file` function should include error handling (e.g., a `try-except` block) to gracefully handle situations where the file might not exist or is not readable.
- The `get_random_sentence` function could benefit from checking for an empty word list before attempting to choose random words to prevent errors.
- The program should explicitly check if the `words.txt` file exists before attempting to process it. If it doesn't exist, the program should provide a helpful message to the user.
- The main function's input validation is good.  However, consider using a more user-friendly approach to guide the user toward valid input, such as a `while` loop that keeps asking for input until valid data is provided.
- The code for Exercise 2 lacks error handling; it should include a `try-except` block to handle potential `KeyError` exceptions during JSON access.  Robust error handling is crucial.

suggestions for improvement:
- The provided code only addresses Exercise 2.  Exercise 1 (random sentence generator) is missing entirely.
- The code lacks error handling (e.g., `try-except` blocks) for file I/O operations, which is mentioned as a key topic in Exercise 1.
- The 'birth_date' should be dynamically obtained, rather than hardcoded.  The instructions suggest this. The exercise expects user input or  a more robust way to get the date.
- The code doesn't show the file saving process (writing the modified JSON to a file), which is a crucial part of Exercise 2.
