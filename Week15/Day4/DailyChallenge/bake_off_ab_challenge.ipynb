    "You’re the data analyst for a popular online bakery, “Sweet Bytes,” known for its delicious treats and innovative digital marketing campaigns. The bakery is about to launch a new checkout process, and the team believes it could significantly boost sales. However, before making the switch, you need to run an A/B test to ensure the new process truly outperforms the current one. To do this, you’ll need to calculate the right sample size to ensure your test is both efficient and reliable. Ready to power up your A/B testing skills and help Sweet Bytes make the right decision? Let’s dive in!"
