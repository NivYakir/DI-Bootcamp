suggestions for improvement:
- For Task 1, consider using explicit joins instead of EXISTS for better readability and potential performance.
- In Task 2, ensure all necessary columns are included in the GROUP BY clause to avoid potential aggregation errors.
- Task 4 is missing. Implement a DELETE statement using a subquery to remove records from a temporary table based on a condition (no medals won).
Brief justification:
- correctness: Task 1 is mostly correct but could benefit from explicit joins. Task 2 correctly identifies the top 5 regions. Task 3 correctly creates and populates the temporary table. Task 4 is missing, reducing the overall correctness score. The code addresses the questions, but there are areas for improvement in each task.
- readability: The code is generally well-formatted and easy to understand. Comments are helpful in explaining the purpose of each task.
- performance: The performance is acceptable, but the use of EXISTS in Task 1 could be optimized with explicit joins. Temporary tables are generally efficient for intermediate results.
- security: The code does not appear to have any obvious security vulnerabilities. Parameterized queries are not necessary in this context as the data is assumed to be trusted.
