suggestions for improvement:
- Consider adding comments to the SQL queries to explain the logic behind each step.
- For better readability, you could break down very long SQL queries into smaller, more manageable chunks using subqueries or CTEs.
- Use parameterized queries or escaping functions when handling user inputs in SQL queries to prevent SQL injection vulnerabilities (though not directly applicable here as there's no user input).
Correctness: 100%
